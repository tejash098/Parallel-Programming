# Parallel-Programming
Overview:-
Parallel programming is a type of programming in which many calculations execute at the same time. Parallel computing is based on the following principle, a computational problem can be divided into smaller sub-problems, which can then be solved simultaneously. Parallel computing assumes the existence of some sort of parallel hardware, which can undertake these computations simultaneously. That is, in parallel.
